## How to contribute to Euphoria MVC

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under
[Issues](https://github.com/OpenEuphoria/euphoria-mvc/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem,
 [open a new one](https://github.com/OpenEuphoria/euphoria-mvc/issues/new).
 Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant
 information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test
 case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution.
  Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability,
functionality, or testability of Euphoria MVC will generally not be accepted. If you're
unsure if this applies to your patch, please post about it on the [OpenEuphoria Forum](
https://openeuphoria.org/forum/).

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change on the [OpenEuphoria Forum](https://openeuphoria.org/forum/) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

* If feature or change has enough support, you'll then be asked to create a new issue on GitHub and then submit a pull request.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Euphoria MVC on the [OpenEuphoria Forum](https://openeuphoria.org/forum/).

Euphoria MVC is a volunteer community effort. We encourage everyone to pitch in!
